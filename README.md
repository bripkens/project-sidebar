# Project Sidebar

A package for changing Atom's project paths. This is a fast alternative to [project-manager's](https://github.com/danielbrodin/atom-project-manager) behavior. project-manager opens projects in new tabs, this package changes the current windows' project paths.

project-sidebar is based on project-manager. You need to have project-manager installed and configured in order to use the project-sidebar.

## Installation
```sh
apm install project-sidebar
```
or find it in the Packages tab under settings

## Usage
All commands can also be found in the Packages menu

### Open Sidebar
`ctrl-alt-p` or **Project Sidebar** in the Command Palette.

### Adding, Updating and Removing Projects
See the [project-manager](https://github.com/danielbrodin/atom-project-manager) documentation for details. project-sidebar uses project-manager's `projects.cson` config file to populate the sidebar.
